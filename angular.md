# Angular architecture


### Observables:
   * an array of data, streamed over time. you subscribe to loop thru the data 
   * observables are subscribed to through the async **AngularPipes** 
   
### Container / Feature Components:

Laymans terms: **RETRIEVE DATA** from the service layer and handle **ROUTES**
   * Note that the top-level COMPONENT OF A #ROUTE is usually a Container Component, and that is why this type of components where originally named like that.

#### Top Level Container Component
	* component can declare several observables on `ngOnInit()`, they're derived from observables obtained from the service layer
	* component will be displayed without any data initially, and it will do one or more calls to the service layer to fetch the data.

# ContainerComponent

#### Presentational Components
Laymans terms: these components simply take DATA AS INPUT and know HOW TO DISPLAY it on the screen. They also can EMIT CUSTOM EVENTS
